# CS465-fullstack

In this full stack development course, I learned to build web applications using different frontend approaches, including Express with HTML, JavaScript, and React for single-page applications (SPAs). While Express and HTML provided a basic structure, JavaScript added interactivity, and React enabled dynamic, reusable UI components for a smoother user experience.

On the backend, I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for its flexibility and seamless integration with JavaScript. JSON was essential for data exchange between frontend and backend, enabling smooth communication and efficient functionality.

Throughout the project, I refactored code to improve performance and maintainability, particularly by creating reusable UI components. I also learned to test API endpoints using Postman tool and handled added complexities like authentication and route protection.

Overall, this course strengthened my skills in full stack development, improved my understanding of secure application architecture, and prepared me to be a more competitive and confident candidate in the tech industry.
